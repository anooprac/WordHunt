# WordHunt

This is a fully functional game of Word Hunt implemented in Java Swing. To get started, go to WordHuntTester and start the game. A panle will be prompted with the grid and a place where you can type out answers. Words need to be made from contiguous characters. You can either type the characters in the text box or press the letter (the grid is made of buttons). Answer as many words as you can before the timer runs out by pressing enter or the enter button. Once the game is over, press reset to play another game.
